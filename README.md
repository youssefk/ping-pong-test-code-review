# _Ping-Pong Test Code Review_

##### _This is a page for inputting a number and then the page counts up towards the inputted number from 1 with Ping, Pong, and Ping-Pong appearing at certain intervals using jQuery and JavaScript looping techniques learned in class._

#### By _**Youssef Khalifa**_

## Description

_Here you will see a page with a prompt to enter a positive number. Upon answering the prompt, a list of numbers will be shown starting from 1, up to the number you entered. For every number that is perfectly divisible by 3 or 5, Ping or Pong will be in place of that number respectively. For any numbers where 3 and 5 are both divisible numbers, then Ping-Pong will be displayed. This is an assignment for Epicodus, practicing the skills we learned thus far._
